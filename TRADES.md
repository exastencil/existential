# Summary of Custom Trades

## Armorer

The armorer is a pretty reliable progression villager, since they buy resources that are easily transmutable with the Philosopher's Stone for each tier of Dust.

They also sell one item of progressively better armour at each tier. This makes it worthwhile to have multiple armorers and promote them. Your guards will need reputation so you can give them some of this armour.

Since coal has too high an EMC value for Low Covalence Dust, I used the opportunity to get players to learn Charcoal, which is actually a more EMC-efficient fuel than coal (4 EMC per smelt vs 16 EMC per smelt for Coal).

## Cleric

The Cleric seems to be designed as a progression villager with a potion brewer theme, giving you access to Redstone, Lapis, Glowstone and Ender Pearls simply by trading. ProjectE gates you with Redstone, Glowstone and Diamonds to get a Transmutation Table, so access to Redstone and Glowstone through this is quite impactful. In our case, we start with a Philosopher's Stone, so it isn't as big a deal, but being able to make a replacement if you lose yours is still important.

Crafting potions still requires that you go to the Nether for Nether Wart and Blaze Powder, so I thought I'd highlight that by having them buy those. It also makes sense thematically, since they would consume these to make potions as the player would.

Ender Pearls are removed, because they have no bearing on brewing and are easily obtained through the Philosopher's Stone.

In keeping with the progression theme, this villager has guaranteed trades for Low, Medium and High early. Also, in keeping with the brewing theme, they will sell one random potion at Novice level so it can be cycled, like Enchanted books.

## Fletcher

Fairly predictable merchant, they sell arrows and eventually will buy them too. They also buy the components needed to make arrows for Low and Medium Covalence Dust.
