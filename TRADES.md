# Summary of Custom Trades

## Armorer

The armorer is a pretty reliable progression villager, since they buy resources that are easily transmutable with the Philosopher's Stone for each tier of Dust.

They also sell one item of progressively better armour at each tier. This makes it worthwhile to have multiple armorers and promote them. Your guards will need reputation so you can give them some of this armour.

Since coal has too high an EMC value for Low Covalence Dust, I used the opportunity to get players to learn Charcoal, which is actually a more EMC-efficient fuel than coal (4 EMC per smelt vs 16 EMC per smelt for Coal).

- Novice
  - Buys Charcoal for Low Covalence Dust (*incentivises players to learn charcoal*)
  - Sells Iron Armor for Coal
- Apprentice
  - Buys Copper Ingot for Medium Covalence Dust
  - Sells Chainmail Armor for Coal
- Journeyman

  - Sells Enchanted Gold Armor for Mobius Fuel
- Master
  - Buys Diamond for High Covalence Dust
  - Sells Enchanted Diamond Armor for Aeternalis Fuel

## Butcher

The butcher trades have been adjusted to make a little more sense for his trade. Butchers sell meat, not meals, so I made them buy whole carcasses and sell butchered cuts wherever I could, thanks to Farmer's Delight. The progression also hints to the player that there are ways to make the mear go further and to make better meals, e.g. using Smoked Ham instead of Porchops.

Since, generally speaking, these foods give better hunger and saturation we indicate that they are better to the player by rewarding the player with Medium Covalence Dust right away as opposed to the farmer's Low Covalence Dust.

The fuels are left in mainly to help you unlock trades, since you might have a small village. Almost all trades are medium dust except Kelp Blocks as a way to obtain low dust and smoked ham requires high dust, which you may need to get from another villager.

## Cartographer

While I considered somehow adding hints to atlases in the Cartographer's trades, generated Atlases just wouldn't work. So for now their trades are just the standard trades matched to resonable EMC values. Glass Panes were switched for Glass, since panes don't have an EMC value.

- Novice

  - Sells Empty Maps for High Dust
- Apprentice

## Cleric

The Cleric seems to be designed as a progression villager with a potion brewer theme, giving you access to Redstone, Lapis, Glowstone and Ender Pearls simply by trading. ProjectE gates you with Redstone, Glowstone and Diamonds to get a Transmutation Table, so access to Redstone and Glowstone through this is quite impactful. In our case, we start with a Philosopher's Stone, so it isn't as big a deal, but being able to make a replacement if you lose yours is still important.

Crafting potions still requires that you go to the Nether for Nether Wart and Blaze Powder, so I thought I'd highlight that by having them buy those. It also makes sense thematically, since they would consume these to make potions as the player would.

Ender Pearls are removed, because they have no bearing on brewing and are easily obtained through the Philosopher's Stone.

In keeping with the progression theme, this villager has guaranteed trades for Low, Medium and High early. Also, in keeping with the brewing theme, they will sell one random potion at Novice level so it can be cycled, like Enchanted books.

## Fletcher

Fairly predictable merchant, they sell arrows and eventually will buy them too. They also buy the components needed to make arrows for Low and Medium Covalence Dust.

At the high end you can get an enchanted Bow and better arrows, but you'll need to get High Covalence Dust elsewhere as they don't buy anything that valuable.

  - Sells enchanted Bow for Aeternalis Fuel
- Master
  - Sells Spectral Arrow for High Covalence Dust
  - Sells Tipped Arrows for High Covalence Dust and Arrows

## Leatherworker

Another fairly straightforward merchant. To make it a little different, he always sells a complete set of armor. And after that will buy leather and hide to restock his supplies.

He then acts as a renewable source of leather horse armor and saddles.

And finally sells some enchanted leather armor.
