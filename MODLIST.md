# Existential Mod List

This is a categorized mod list with information about configuration.

## Primary

These mods are added to serve a primary purpose in getting the pack to play a certain way. Ordered roughly by the impact they have on the pack.

### ProjectE by SinKillerJ
This is the primary mod in the pack. It simultaneously speeds up progression and focuses your efforts on what you want to do. It acts as the fulcrum between how you split your time between mining, crafting, farming, building and adventuring. It also creates a path from survival-style gameplay to creative-like gameplay, should you choose to pursue it. Energy Collectors are enabled, but the Watch of Flowing Time is disabled to preserve some longevity.

### ProjectExtended by pupnewfster
Adds some extra tools and weapons that are missing from ProjectE.

### ProjectE Interation by TagnumElite
Mainly for the mappers for Farmer's Delight

### Custom Villager Trades by SpaceCat_97
This removes all the vanilla and modded trades and replaces them with EMC
appropriate ones. I've found that no activity generates EMC quite as fast as
trading with villagers, since emeralds have such a high covalence. Instead,
trades will always favour the villager and use covalence dusts as a currency.

### Guard Villagers by almightytallestred
Gives you more incentive to spend time in villages or live near a village.
Trading with villagers builds reputation allowing you to improve guard gear.

### Quark by Vazkii
Quark changes a lot of small things about the game. The following, in particular
are of interest:

- Iron farms are nerfed. Toretoises replace it with a slightly more involved way to obtain renewable resources.
- Villagers don't retain their cure discounts.
- Matrix enchanting adds a little more flexibility into the enchanting system.
- Some added, intuitive block placing mechanics for easier building and exploring.
- Some changes to terrain generation
- Totem of Holding for preserving your items on death

### Supplementaries by MehVahdJukaar
Similar to Quark, this just adds a bunch of things that help the world feel more lived in. Signs to villages, some decorative and functional items and an alternative source of string and wool in the form of Flax.

### Farmer's Delight by vectorwing
This adds some more farming and cooking options. Eventually the player will stop eating but since farming is a slow, but steady source of EMC the player is rewarded by finding various food sources.

### Map Atlases by lilypuree
The most vanilla-feeling mapping solution I've seen. It keeps maps relevant and still requires you to plan and be conscious of where you are.

### KubeJS by LatvianModder
This is used generally to modify disable or add recipes.

## Quality of Life

These mods add conveniences that generally improve the feel of the pack or adds to the enjoyment by streamlining the gameplay.

### AppleSkin by squeek502
Shows hunger and saturation, as well as the results of eating held food.

### AmbientSounds 5 by CreativeMD
Just adds better sound to the game.

### Better Recipe Books (+ Brewing Stands) by marshycity
To add pinning and scrolling to recipe books so we don't need JEI.

### Chalk by mortuus_art
Helps you find your way in caves and the nether without developing a torch placement system.

### ChickensShed by holmraven
Chickens drop feathers in addition to laying eggs. Slightly more realistic.

### Comforts by TheIllusiveC4
Sleeping bags and hammocks to sleep while traveling, and to pass the day, respectively.

### Cosmetic Armor Reworked by LainMI
Mostly added to be able to hide armour, and keep your skin displayed. Especially if you don't like the look of ProjectE armour during endgame.

### Curios API by TheIllusiveC4
Extra slots for items that one would usually equip.

### Curious Elytra by TheIllusiveC4
Allows the Elytra to fit on the Back curio slot, so you can still wear armour.

### Enchantment Descriptions by DarkhaxDev
Shows what an enchantment does in tooltips, since there's no JEI.

### Fast Leaf Decay by olafskiii
No one has time to watch trees grow, let alone wait for leaves to decay.

### Mouse Tweaks by YaLTeR
Every modpack should have this. Better mouse interaction for inventories. Scrolling and click-dragging to move items faster.

### Quark Oddities by Vazkii
Enables backpacks to help you manage inventory until you get transmutation.

### Curios Quark Oddities Backpack by 6LeoMC
This lets you put the backpack in the back slot. This is important since the backpack is meant to tide you over until the Transmutation Table becomes your primary inventory management solution. At this point you'll mostly still be in iron armour and you need the chestplate. Once you get Elytra, you likely won't need the backpack any more.

### The One Probe by McJty
Only the simplest of tooltips, since there isn't much in the way of advanced mods in the pack.

### Trade Cycling by henkelmax
Allows you to cycle trades more quickly. Since you can do it anyway, this is just faster. All trades will be custom to ensure none are EMC exploits and significant trades are more likely to be higher tier anyway.
