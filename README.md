# Existential
 _Minecraft Modpack for Players with Little Time_

I am creating Existential to be the pack I want to play, but can't find. Before
creating Existential I played a few packs that heavily influenced my
decision-making process. Two of them are key:

1. [Bliss](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/bliss) by [Vazkii](https://www.curseforge.com/members/vazkii)
2. [Project Architect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/project-architect) by [ChosenArchitect](https://www.youtube.com/ChosenArchitect)

Bliss focused on adding content true to the spirit of Minecraft while making the
game more accessible, removing standard iron farms and exploitative villager
trading and replacing it with more balanced alternatives.

Project Architect focused on an accelerated start and easier item management
thanks to [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) and
many building and tech mods for longevity.

The balance I want to strike is a very lightweight pack that feels similar to
vanilla Minecraft, adding some quality of life and convenience so you can get to
what you want to do quicker; preferably without quickly hitting a point where
there is nothing left to do except chase some artificially far off goal like
fight the Chaos Dragon.

**In essence:**

- Bliss,
- without the peaceful stuff,
- with ProjectE
- and some balance tweaks to rein in ProjectE

## Goals of the Pack

- Stay pretty close to Vanilla
- Add quality of life enhancements
- Remove some of the tedium to facilitate building
- Try not to short circuit mechanics
